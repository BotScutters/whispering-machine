# Whispering Machine

Interactive party tracker with ESP32 sensor nodes and MacBook Pro hub featuring real-time audio transcription, occupancy tracking, and dynamic LED visualizations.

## Architecture

- **MacBook Pro Hub**: Central controller with 7" touchscreen, runs all services (MQTT, Aggregator, UI, Audio Bridge, LLM Agent)
- **ESP32 Nodes (x3)**: Remote sensors with INMP441 mics, PIR sensors, rotary encoders, and WS2812 LED rings
- **unRAID Server**: External faster-whisper transcription service (via Tailscale)

## Quickstart

### Development (unRAID)
```bash
# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Development runs on unRAID with Docker containers
# Test services locally
cp .env.example .env
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
# Open http://localhost:8000/debug

# Run comprehensive tests (Docker-based)
./run_tests_docker.sh

# Run individual service tests
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/services/aggregator:/app infra-aggregator python test_multi_node.py
```

### Production (MacBook)
```bash
# One-time setup (on MacBook)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER/whispering-machine/main/scripts/macbook_bootstrap.sh | bash

# Deploy from unRAID
./scripts/macbook_deploy.sh

# Access party tracker
# http://localhost:8000/party
```
