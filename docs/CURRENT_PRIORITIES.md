# Current Priorities (MVP: Pi Hub Deployment)

## Status: ðŸš¨ CRITICAL - Pi Hub Integration Required for MVP

**Last Updated**: October 14, 2025

**MAJOR ARCHITECTURE SHIFT**: Moving from unRAID-hosted services to Raspberry Pi 5 hub as the central controller. All services (MQTT, Aggregator, UI) will run on Pi, with ESP32 nodes connecting to Pi's broker. Pi will use Tailscale to reach unRAID's faster-whisper service for transcription.

**Timeline**: Few working days remaining - focus on critical path only.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PATH (MVP Deadline)

**Goal**: Get Pi hub running with all services, ESP32 nodes connected, and transcription working.

**Estimated Total Time**: 15-20 hours

### Phase 1: Pi Infrastructure (CRITICAL)
**T-021: Pi Bootstrap Script** (2-3 hours)
- One-time Pi setup: Docker, IÂ²S, Tailscale
- **Blocker**: Must complete before any other Pi work
- **Owner**: Start immediately

**T-022: Pi Docker Compose Stack** (2-3 hours)
- Migrate MQTT, Aggregator, UI to Pi
- **Depends on**: T-021
- **Owner**: Start after bootstrap tested

**T-025: ESP32 Firmware Config** (30 minutes)
- Point ESP32 nodes to Pi MQTT broker
- **Depends on**: T-022
- **Owner**: Quick win after Pi stack running

### Phase 2: Audio Transcription (CRITICAL)
**T-023: Audio Bridge Service** (4-6 hours)
- Pi INMP441 â†’ unRAID Whisper â†’ MQTT
- **Depends on**: T-022 (needs MQTT broker)
- **Owner**: Can start in parallel with T-025

### Phase 3: Deployment & UI (HIGH)
**T-024: Pi Deployment Script** (1-2 hours)
- Automate unRAID â†’ Pi deployment
- **Depends on**: T-022
- **Owner**: Start after stack working

**T-027: Party Tracker UI** (4-6 hours)
- Touchscreen-optimized UI with transcripts
- **Depends on**: T-023 (needs transcript data)
- **Owner**: Start after transcription working

**T-026: Transcript Panel Component** (2-3 hours)
- Reusable transcript display component
- **Depends on**: T-023
- **Owner**: Part of T-027, can be concurrent

## Execution Plan (Recommended Order)

### Day 1: Pi Foundation
1. âœ… **T-021** - Bootstrap Pi (morning)
2. âœ… **T-022** - Pi compose stack (afternoon)
3. âœ… **T-025** - ESP32 config (evening)
4. **Checkpoint**: ESP32 nodes publishing to Pi, UI showing data

### Day 2: Audio Pipeline
5. âœ… **T-023** - Audio bridge (full day)
6. **Checkpoint**: Transcripts appearing in MQTT

### Day 3: Polish & Deploy
7. âœ… **T-024** - Deployment script (morning)
8. âœ… **T-027** - Party tracker UI (afternoon/evening)
9. **Checkpoint**: Full system running on Pi, ready for demo

## Deferred (Post-MVP)

These are valuable but not critical for MVP:

- **T-018**: Generic node auto-discovery (nice-to-have)
- **T-001**: Loudness sparkline (polish)
- **T-002**: Mood detection (future enhancement)
- **Audio tuning**: RMS scaling, PIR calibration (can tune live)
- **LED refinement**: Mode adjustments (working well enough)
