# Current Priorities (Party Night: MacBook Interface)

## Status: üö® CRITICAL - 3 Days to Party Night

**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025

**MAJOR PIVOT**: Pi is dead. MacBook now serves as the central hub, driving 7" touchscreen and running all services. Focus on creating a compelling "unreliable narrator" that works even with spotty ESP32 sensors.

**Timeline**: 3 days remaining - focus on party-ready interface only.

## Party Night Requirements

### Core Vision
> "The Whispering Machine listens. Scattered through the room, its small sensor nodes observe light, movement, and fragments of speech‚Äìquietly feeding them into a shared digital mind. The system murmurs back in text and light, a half-comprehending echo of the conversations and energies that surround it. It is playful, confident, and untrustworthy."

### Technical Requirements
- **MacBook**: Runs all services, drives 7" touchscreen, lid can be closed
- **Audio**: MacBook built-in mic ‚Üí Whisper transcription via Tailscale
- **Sensors**: 3 ESP32 nodes (even if unreliable/garbage signals)
- **Interface**: Compelling, unreliable narrator aesthetic
- **Runtime**: 6+ hours standalone operation
- **Robustness**: Works with 0-3 functioning sensors

## üö® CRITICAL PATH (3 Days to Party)

**Goal**: MacBook-based party interface that whispers what it hears, even when it's not sure.

**Estimated Total Time**: 22-28 hours

### Day 1: Foundation (8-10 hours)
**T-028: MacBook Service Stack** (2-3 hours)
- Docker compose for MacBook
- All services running locally
- **Blocker**: Must work before anything else

**T-029: MacBook Audio Bridge** (3-4 hours) ‚≠ê MOST COMPLEX
- Built-in mic capture with lid closed
- Whisper transcription via Tailscale
- **Critical**: Audio is core to the experience

**T-030: Multi-Node Support** (2-3 hours)
- Handle 3 ESP32 nodes
- Robust to unreliable signals
- **Depends on**: T-028

**Checkpoint**: MacBook running all services, 3 nodes connected, audio transcription working

### Day 2: Interface & Intelligence (8-10 hours)
**T-031: Party Interface UI** (4-5 hours) ‚≠ê MOST VISIBLE
- 7" touchscreen optimized
- Unreliable narrator aesthetic
- **Critical**: This is what people see

**T-032: LLM Agent Service** (3-4 hours)
- Generate unsettling observations
- Incorporate sensor data + randomness
- **Key**: Makes it "intelligent-sounding"

**T-033: Robust Data Processing** (2-3 hours)
- Handle garbage sensor data gracefully
- Confidence indicators
- **Important**: System works even when sensors fail

**Checkpoint**: Compelling interface with intelligent observations, works with unreliable sensors

### Day 3: Polish & Deploy (6-8 hours)
**T-034: Touchscreen Setup** (2-3 hours)
- Closed-lid MacBook operation
- External display configuration
- **Important**: Hide the MacBook

**T-035: Party Mode Deployment** (2-3 hours)
- End-to-end testing
- Emergency procedures
- **Critical**: Must work on party night

**Checkpoint**: Ready for party night, tested for 6+ hours

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. MacBook Closed-Lid Operation
**Challenge**: Run services and capture audio with lid closed
**Research Needed**: macOS behavior, Core Audio, power management
**Fallback**: Leave lid open, display black screen

### 2. Unreliable Sensor Handling
**Challenge**: Make garbage signals compelling, not broken
**Approach**: Embrace uncertainty as part of the aesthetic
**Implementation**: Confidence indicators, partial data, plausible fakes

### 3. LLM Integration
**Challenge**: Generate unsettling observations without being obvious
**Approach**: Mix real sensor data with randomness
**Implementation**: Rate limiting, fallback responses, varied prompts

### 4. 6+ Hour Runtime
**Challenge**: System stability for entire party
**Approach**: Robust error handling, auto-recovery, monitoring
**Implementation**: Health checks, graceful degradation, logging

## Design Principles

### Unreliable Narrator Aesthetic
- **Playful, confident, untrustworthy**
- Show partial information
- Inject plausible but uncertain data
- Use confidence indicators (high/medium/low/unknown)
- Embrace sensor failures as part of the experience

### Robust Operation
- **Works with 0-3 sensors**
- Graceful degradation when nodes fail
- 6+ hour runtime without intervention
- Closed-lid MacBook operation
- Emergency recovery procedures

### Party-Ready Interface
- **7" touchscreen optimized**
- Large, readable text from 3 feet away
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Full-screen, no browser chrome
- Compelling even when sensors fail

---

## Deferred (Post-Party)

These are valuable but not critical for party night:

- **Pi hub tickets (T-021-T027)**: Pi is dead
- **Sensor debugging**: Fix INMP441 wiring issues
- **LED refinement**: Mode adjustments
- **Generic node auto-discovery**: Nice-to-have
- **Mood detection**: Future enhancement
- **Audio tuning**: Can tune live if needed

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **T-029 (Audio Bridge)**: Complex macOS audio capture, closed-lid behavior
  - Mitigation: Research thoroughly, test early, have fallback plan
- **T-031 (Party Interface)**: Most visible, must be compelling
  - Mitigation: Start with simple version, iterate quickly

### Medium Risk
- **T-032 (LLM Agent)**: API dependencies, rate limiting
  - Mitigation: Implement fallback responses, test with API disabled
- **T-034 (Touchscreen Setup)**: macOS display management
  - Mitigation: Test on actual hardware early

### Low Risk
- **T-028 (Service Stack)**: Reusing existing services
- **T-030 (Multi-Node)**: Extending existing aggregator
- **T-033 (Robust Processing)**: Software-only changes
- **T-035 (Deployment)**: Scripting and testing

## Notes

- **Focus**: Party-ready interface, not perfect sensors
- **Aesthetic**: Unreliable narrator is the goal, not bug-free operation
- **Timeline**: 3 days is tight but doable with focused effort
- **Testing**: Must test with actual hardware early and often
- **Backup**: Always have a fallback plan

**The machine whispers what it hears, even when it's not sure what it heard.** üé≠
