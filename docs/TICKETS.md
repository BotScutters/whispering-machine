## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PATH: MacBook Party Interface (3 Days to Party)

**Architecture**: MacBook runs all services, drives 7" touchscreen, connects to ESP32 nodes + Whisper via Tailscale. Interface must be robust to unreliable sensors and work standalone for 6+ hours.

### T-028: MacBook Service Stack Setup
**Status**: TODO  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Goal**: Set up MacBook to run all services locally with Docker.

**Tasks**:
- Create `macbook/compose.yml` with services:
  - `mosquitto` (MQTT broker)
  - `aggregator` (processes all node data)
  - `ui` (serves party interface)
  - `audio_bridge` (MacBook mic â†’ Whisper)
  - `llm_agent` (NEW - generates observations)
- Create `macbook/.env.example` with MacBook-specific config
- Add MacBook-specific Dockerfile optimizations
- Configure for closed-lid operation (if possible)

**Acceptance**:
- `docker compose -f macbook/compose.yml up -d` starts all services
- Services run with MacBook lid closed (test 30 minutes)
- MQTT broker reachable at `localhost:1883`
- UI accessible at `http://localhost:8000/party`

**Test**:
```bash
cd /path/to/whispering-machine
docker compose -f macbook/compose.yml up -d
docker ps  # All services running
# Close MacBook lid, wait 30 min, reopen - services still running
```

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### T-029: MacBook Audio Bridge (Built-in Mic â†’ Whisper)
**Status**: TODO  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Goal**: Capture audio from MacBook built-in microphone, send to Whisper, publish transcripts.

**Tasks**:
- Create `services/audio_bridge/` (reuse from Pi design)
- Implement macOS audio capture (Core Audio / AVAudioEngine)
- Handle closed-lid audio capture (research macOS behavior)
- Implement HTTP client for Whisper (Wyoming protocol)
- Publish transcripts to `party/<house>/macbook/speech/transcript`
- Add fallback for when Whisper is unavailable
- Implement audio chunking (2-5 second segments)

**Acceptance**:
- Captures audio from MacBook mic with lid closed
- Sends audio chunks to Whisper via Tailscale
- Publishes transcripts to MQTT within 5 seconds
- Gracefully handles Whisper downtime
- Works for 6+ hours without intervention

**Test**:
```bash
# With MacBook lid closed
docker logs macbook_audio_bridge --tail 50
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t 'party/+/macbook/speech/transcript'
# Speak near MacBook, should see transcript within 5s
# Leave running overnight, verify still working
```

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### T-030: ESP32 Multi-Node Support (3 Nodes)
**Status**: TODO  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Goal**: Support 3 ESP32 nodes with robust handling of unreliable signals.

**Tasks**:
- Update aggregator to handle 3 nodes (node1, node2, node3)
- Add node health monitoring (heartbeat timeout detection)
- Implement graceful degradation when nodes go offline
- Add signal quality scoring (detect "garbage" signals)
- Update UI to show node status (online/offline/degraded)
- Add node discovery (auto-detect new nodes)

**Acceptance**:
- All 3 nodes appear in UI
- UI shows node health status
- System works when 1-2 nodes are offline/degraded
- Garbage signals are filtered out or marked as unreliable
- New nodes auto-appear when they connect

**Test**:
```bash
# Start with all 3 nodes
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t 'party/+/+/+/+' -v
# Disconnect node3, verify UI shows it as offline
# Reconnect node3, verify it reappears
# Test with garbage signals from node3
```

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

  - Glitchy text effects
  - Partial/obscured information
  - Confidence indicators (high/medium/low/unknown)
  - Random data injection
- Add screensaver mode (black screen with subtle activity)
- Implement auto-refresh and error recovery

**Acceptance**:
- Loads full-screen on touchscreen
- Large, readable text from 3 feet away
- Touch interactions work reliably
- Runs for 6+ hours without browser refresh
- Handles network disconnections gracefully

### T-032: LLM Agent Service (Observations & Interpretations)
**Status**: TODO  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Goal**: Generate intelligent-sounding observations from sensor data to "freak people out".

**Tasks**:
- Create `services/llm_agent/` service
- Implement OpenAI/Anthropic API client
- Create prompt templates for different scenarios:
  - Audio analysis ("I heard someone mention...")
  - Occupancy patterns ("The energy shifted when...")
  - LED interactions ("The lights responded to...")
  - Random observations ("I notice that...")
- Add data injection (sensor data + randomness)
- Publish observations to `party/<house>/macbook/observations`
- Implement rate limiting (don't spam API)
- Add fallback responses when API unavailable

**Acceptance**:
- Generates observations every 2-5 minutes
- Observations sound intelligent and slightly unsettling
- Incorporates real sensor data when available
- Works when sensors are unreliable
- Gracefully handles API failures
- Observations appear in party UI

**Test**:
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t 'party/+/macbook/observations'
# Should see observations every few minutes
# Test with API disabled (fallback responses)
# Test with unreliable sensor data
```

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

  - Detect unrealistic values (wiring issues)
- Add data interpolation/filling for missing values
- Implement "unreliable narrator" data presentation:
  - Show confidence levels
  - Display partial information
