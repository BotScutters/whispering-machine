# Cursor Rules for Whispering Machine

## Pre-Development Checklist
- Always read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/TICKETS.md`, and `docs/AGENT_MEMORY.md` before proposing changes
- Check existing code patterns in `services/`, `esphome/`, `esp/` before implementing
- Review MQTT schemas in `schemas/` directory for payload validation

## Code Standards
- **Python**: 3.10, Google style, line length 88, use type hints + docstrings
- **Formatting**: Black + Ruff + isort for Python; run `./dev.sh fmt` before committing
- **Async**: Prefer asyncio; validate MQTT payloads with Pydantic models
- **Logging**: Use structured logs to stdout, include context and timestamps

## Architecture Constraints
- **Privacy**: Do not stream raw audio; remote nodes publish features only
- **Networking**: Use service DNS + port 1883 inside compose; host port mappings are for LAN tools only
- **MQTT Topics**: Follow `party/<house>/<node>/<domain>/<signal>` pattern
- **Message Format**: Small JSON with stable keys and unix `ts_ms` timestamp

## Development Workflow
- Pick a single ticket from `docs/TICKETS.md` and restate acceptance criteria
- Propose minimal plan with file deltas before implementing
- Keep PRs small and focused; test locally with `./dev.sh up`
- Update `docs/AGENT_MEMORY.md` with any new rules or gotchas discovered
- Mark tickets as done in `docs/TICKETS.md` with commit hash

## Testing Requirements
- Test MQTT message flows with `mosquitto_sub` and `mosquitto_pub`
- Verify UI updates with screenshots/GIFs for visual changes
- Check service recovery after broker restarts
- Validate feature behavior with actual sensor inputs

## Common Pitfalls (from Agent Memory)
- **Paho MQTT v2**: Use 5-arg callback signature `(client, userdata, flags, reason_code, properties=None)`
- **Port Usage**: Inside compose use service DNS + 1883, not host port 1884
- **Message Validation**: Always validate MQTT payloads with Pydantic models
- **Error Handling**: Services must gracefully handle broker disconnections and reconnections

## Don'ts
- Don't change MQTT shapes without updating `schemas/` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Don't add heavy dependencies unless justified in PR description
- Don't implement features not listed in tickets without discussion
- Don't bypass the aggregator for direct UI updates
